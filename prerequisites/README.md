# Prerequisites for OSAC Installation

## Overview

The OSAC solution requires several components to be installed on the cluster before deployment.
Your administrator may have set up some of these components already. Check with them first
before installing.

The manifests in this directory are examples for development and testing environments.

## Required Components

| Component | Purpose | Manifest |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Cert Manager | TLS certificate management | `cert-manager/cert-manager.yaml` |
| Trust Manager | CA certificate distribution | `trust-manager.yaml` |
| CA Issuer | ClusterIssuer for signing certificates | `ca-issuer.yaml` |
| Keycloak | Identity provider (OIDC) | `keycloak/` |
| Red Hat AAP Operator | Ansible Automation Platform | `aap-installation.yaml` |

## Optional Components

| Component | Purpose | Manifest |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| LVMS | Storage service (StorageClass) | `lvms/` |
| MetalLB | LoadBalancer service for bare metal | `metallb/` |
| MCE | Multicluster Engine for CaaS | `mce/` |
| OpenShift Virtualization | VM as a Service support | `cnv/` |

**Note:** Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) is assumed to be already installed.

## Installation

Install components in order — some depend on earlier ones.

### Step 1: Cert Manager

```bash
oc apply -f prerequisites/cert-manager/cert-manager.yaml

# Wait for the operator to be ready
oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/cert-manager -n cert-manager --timeout=300s
oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/cert-manager-webhook -n cert-manager --timeout=300s
```

### Step 2: Trust Manager

Requires cert-manager to be running.

```bash
oc apply -f prerequisites/trust-manager.yaml
oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/trust-manager -n cert-manager --timeout=300s
```

### Step 3: CA Issuer

Creates a self-signed ClusterIssuer for signing certificates.

```bash
oc apply -f prerequisites/ca-issuer.yaml
oc wait clusterissuer/default-ca --for=condition=Ready --timeout=300s
```

### Step 4: Keycloak

Identity provider for OIDC authentication.

```bash
oc apply -f prerequisites/keycloak/namespace.yaml
oc create configmap keycloak-db-server-config \
    --from-file=server.conf=prerequisites/keycloak/database/files/server.conf \
    -n keycloak --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
oc create configmap keycloak-db-access-config \
    --from-file=access.conf=prerequisites/keycloak/database/files/access.conf \
    -n keycloak --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
oc create configmap keycloak-realm \
    --from-file=realm.json=prerequisites/keycloak/service/files/realm.json \
    -n keycloak --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
oc apply -f prerequisites/keycloak/database/ -n keycloak
oc apply -f prerequisites/keycloak/service/ -n keycloak
oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/keycloak-service -n keycloak --timeout=600s
```

### Step 5: Red Hat AAP Operator

Ansible Automation Platform for provisioning workflows.

```bash
oc apply -f prerequisites/aap-installation.yaml

# Wait for the operator to be installed
oc get csv -n ansible-aap | grep ansible-automation-platform
```

### Step 6: Optional Components

See `scripts/setup.sh` for automated installation of LVMS, MetalLB, MCE, and
OpenShift Virtualization. Each optional component has an operator manifest and a
config manifest that requires the operator CRDs to exist first.

## Verification

After installing all prerequisites, verify the components are running:

```bash
# Cert Manager
oc get pods -n cert-manager

# Keycloak
oc get pods -n keycloak

# AAP
oc get pods -n ansible-aap
```

## Notes

- These manifests are provided as examples for development environments
- Production deployments may require additional configuration
- Consult your cluster administrator before installing operators
- Some resources depend on CRDs that are created by operators; if an apply fails, wait for the operator to finish installing and try again
